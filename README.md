# ESP32-C3 Interactive Game Device

A compact experimental hardware concept based on an ESP32-C3, featuring four Cherry MX mechanical switches and LEDs as a flexible input–output system for small interactive games and logic experiments.

The device is fully portable thanks to an integrated battery. A small OLED display with a very clean UI is controlled entirely via the switches and allows users to easily switch between different games. Possible modes include memory, reaction, rhythm, and logic games. Two devices can also be wirelessly paired to play together or compete against each other.

Diffuse underglow lighting made from PC filament provides clear and even visual feedback, emphasizing the balance between physical input, visual output, and embedded game logic.
